# Testing Browseek

Browseek uses the `unittest` framework for testing. This document provides information on how to run the test suite and write new tests for Browseek.

## Running Tests

To run the test suite for Browseek, use the following command:
```
python -m unittest discover tests
```

This command will discover and run all the test files located in the `tests/` directory.

## Writing Tests

When adding new features or making changes to Browseek, it's important to write tests to ensure the correctness of the code. Follow these guidelines when writing tests:

1. Create a new test file in the `tests/` directory for the module or functionality you are testing.
2. Import the necessary modules and classes from Browseek.
3. Define test classes that inherit from `unittest.TestCase`.
4. Write test methods to cover different scenarios and edge cases.
5. Use assertions to verify the expected behavior of the code.
6. Run the tests to ensure they pass.

Here's an example test file structure:

```python
import unittest
from browseek import SomeClass

class TestSomeClass(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Set up any necessary test fixtures
        pass

    def tearDown(self):
        # Clean up any test fixtures
        pass

    def test_some_method(self):
        # Test a specific method or functionality
        result = SomeClass().some_method()
        self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)

    def test_another_method(self):
        # Test another method or functionality
        result = SomeClass().another_method()
        self.assertTrue(result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## Test Coverage

To measure the test coverage of Browseek, you can use the `coverage` package. Install it by running:
```
pip install coverage
```

To generate a coverage report, use the following commands:
```
coverage run -m unittest discover tests
coverage report
```

This will run the tests and display a coverage report in the console, showing the percentage of code covered by tests.

## Continuous Integration

Browseek uses continuous integration (CI) to automatically run tests on each push and pull request. The CI configuration can be found in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

When submitting a pull request, the CI system will automatically run the tests and report any failures. Please ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Test-Driven Development

We encourage contributors to follow the principles of test-driven development (TDD) when adding new features or making changes to Browseek. The TDD workflow involves the following steps:

1. Write a failing test that describes the desired behavior.
2. Run the test and ensure it fails.
3. Implement the code to make the test pass.
4. Refactor the code if necessary.
5. Repeat the process for the next feature or change.

By following TDD, you can ensure that the code is thoroughly tested and meets the desired requirements.

If you have any questions or need assistance with testing, please don't hesitate to reach out to the Browseek maintainers. Happy testing!
